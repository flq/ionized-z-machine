This project follows along [Eric Lippert's](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/01/west-of-house/) series in
developing a Z-Machine in OCaml.

Instead it uses F# - since there is a clear lineage between the two languages,
I don't expect too much work, but we shall see ;)

Every time I reach the same point as a blog post from Eric, I will tag it with the blog post title
such that the progress is easily trackable.
